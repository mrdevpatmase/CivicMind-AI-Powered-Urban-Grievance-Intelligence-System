# CivicMind – AI-Powered Urban Grievance Intelligence System

CivicMind is a smart urban grievance management platform that uses **AI (NLP, ML, LLM-ready)** to automatically classify, prioritize, and summarize citizen complaints for faster municipal response and better governance transparency.

This project is being built for a hackathon and focuses on **end-to-end AI + system integration**, not just models.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Municipal corporations receive thousands of complaints daily related to:
- waste management
- water supply
- road damage
- streetlights
- sanitation

These complaints are often:
- manually processed
- poorly prioritized
- slow to resolve
- hard to track

CivicMind solves this using **AI-driven automation + dashboards**.

---

## 🧠 Core Features (Planned & In Progress)

### ✅ AI Features
- NLP-based complaint categorization (working)
- AI-based priority assignment (working)
- Confidence-based fallback logic
- Modular AI pipeline (working)
- LLM-ready complaint summarization (next)

### 🖥️ System Features
- Citizen complaint submission (in progress)
- Officer dashboard (in progress)
- Admin analytics dashboard (in progress)
- Real-time status tracking
- Map-based visualization (planned)

---

## 🏗️ Current Project Status
**AI pipeline is completed and stable**

✔ Dataset created  
✔ Model trained (96% accuracy)  
✔ Model saved and versioned  
✔ Inference module ready  
✔ Pipeline ready for backend integration  

Backend & frontend development is currently ongoing.
